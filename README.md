## About this project

I made this project by following the tutorial [Letâ€™s Build a Pokedex with React](https://blog.cloudboost.io/lets-build-a-pokedex-with-react-part-1-e1ba0b9387a7).

My goal is to learn React, so I followed this tutorial to learn by practcing.

Also, I made some modifications in order to practice more and for fun, like allowing the user to search a pokemon by it's name.

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
